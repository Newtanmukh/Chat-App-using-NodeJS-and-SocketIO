in HTTP (GET or POST) or in normal cconnections, since it is one way,server wont be able to send requests to client. 
only client can request the server.

web socket solves this problem by  making a two way connection.

in HTTP , there might be many wastage of requests from the client side. in socket.io it does not happen.

there will be two of them, a client and a server(chat server).
client can be thought of as an independent website. server is the one  which is gonna listen to us.
